Project Title:

Invoicing ROI Simulator

Objective:
To develop a web application that simulates and visualizes the cost savings, ROI, and payback period for businesses switching from manual to automated invoicing systems.

Problem Statement:
Many businesses manually process invoices, leading to inefficiencies, errors, and higher labor costs. This project aims to demonstrate how automation can reduce costs and improve ROI through an interactive web-based ROI simulator.

Proposed Solution:
The solution is a full-stack web application that allows users to:
Input business metrics such as invoice volume, staff size, and wages.
Instantly calculate monthly savings, ROI %, and payback period.
Save multiple simulation scenarios for future reference.
Download a report (PDF/HTML) after entering their email.

Key Features:
1.Quick ROI simulation
2.CRUD support (Save, Load, Delete scenarios)
3.Report generation with email input
4.Always favorable automation results (bias factor)
5.Simple and responsive UI

Tech Stack:
Layer	Technology
Frontend	HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Backend	Node.js, Express.js
Database	JSON file (local)
Deployment	Render (for hosting)
Architecture Overview:
[Frontend (HTML/JS)]  ⇄  [Backend (Express API)]  ⇄  [Database (JSON)]

Planned Modules:

1. Simulation Module — Takes user inputs and computes savings, ROI, and payback.
2. Scenario Module — Enables saving and managing different input sets.
3. Report Module — Generates a report after entering email.
4. Database Layer — Persists saved scenarios locally.

Expected Output:

Interactive ROI results displayed on screen.
Saved scenarios listed in a table or dropdown.
Report downloadable in HTML format.

Timeline (2 Hours):
Time	Task
0–15 mins	Documentation & planning
15–60 mins	Build backend (API + calculations)
60–100 mins	Build frontend UI
100–120 mins	Deploy, test, and prepare final docs

Expected Outcome:
A fully functional web-based ROI Simulator demonstrating measurable cost advantages of automated invoicing, deployable within 3 hours.
